These plugins are responsible for providing tests.

The tests will get run against the just-written file.



API:
----

plugins must have the following:

A module-level attribute "pluginVersion" that has a compatible
version for ideemon

pluginVersion = (1,0)


A function called "findTestsFor" that takes one argument: the full
path to the file to be tested.  This function must return a 
(possibly empty) list of tuples.  The tuples each represent a test
to be run.  This is an important detail; the plugin does not run 
the test itself, it just returns a test.  The tuple is of the
form ( test_function, args, kwargs ).  The args and kwargs will be
passed to the test_function in the conventional way,
test_function( *args, **kwargs )

def findTestsFor(fpath):
    ...
    return [ (myTestFn, (arg1, arg2,), {'foo':1, 'bar':2}),
             ... ]
