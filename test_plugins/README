These plugins are responsible for providing tests.

The tests will get run against the just-written file.



API:
----

plugins must have the following:

A module-level attribute "__plugin_version" that has a compatible
version for ideemon

__plugin_version = (1,0)


A function called "find_tests_for" that takes one argument: the full
path to the file to be tested.  This function must return a
(possibly empty) list of dicts.  The dicts each represent a test
to be run.  This is an important detail; the plugin does not run
the test itself, it just returns a test spec.

The dicts are of the form
    {
     'make_cmd_fn': ..., # a function that makes a bash command (string)
     'args': ...,        # passed in to make_cmd_fn
     'kwargs': ...,      # passed in to make_cmd_fn
     'report_fn': ...,   # parses stdout,stderr and returns a list of errors
     ... any additional values are optional ...
    }
