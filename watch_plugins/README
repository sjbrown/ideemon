These plugins are responsible for telling the main loop
which directories to watch for changes.



API:
----

plugins must have the following:

A module-level attribute "pluginVersion" that has a compatible
version for ideemon

pluginVersion = (1,0)


A function called "directoriesToWatch" that returns a (possibly
empty) list of full directory paths.

def directoriesToWatch():
    dirs = []
    ...
    # populate dirs
    ...
    return dirs
