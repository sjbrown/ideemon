These plugins are responsible for telling the main loop
how to set up special environments for running tests



API:
----

plugins must have the following:

A module-level attribute "__plugin_version" that has a compatible
version for ideemon

__plugin_version = (1,0)

A module-level function "find_environment(spec)" that returns
a Context Manager for a given environment spec.  The spec is
just a string.  If your plugin doesn't recognize it, that's
fine, just return None.  Try not to collide with any other
plugins' specs.

def find_environment(spec):
    if spec == 'subprocess':
        return context
